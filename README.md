# Using Terraform to build ROSA cluster with Private Link enabled and STS

Red Hat Openshift Service on AWS (ROSA) is a fully-managed turnkey application platform. A ROSA cluster can be created without any requirements on public subnets, internet gateways, or network address translation (NAT) gateways. In this configuration, Red Hat uses AWS PrivateLink to manage and monitor a cluster to avoid all public ingress network traffic.

To deploy Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) into your existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, Red Hat requires several prerequisites to be met. There are several [requirements ](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html#rosa-sts-aws-prereqs), [Review AWS service quota](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas.html#rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotasr) and [enable ROSA in your AWS account Access](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-setting-up-environment.html#rosa-sts-setting-up-environment).


NOTE: STS(secure token service) allows us to deploy ROSA without needing a ROSA admin account, instead it uses roles and policies with Amazon STS to gain access to the AWS resources needed to install and operate the cluster.

In this series, we use Terraform to provision all resources in AWS to deploy a ROSA cluster with Privatelink and STS.  

## Create the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPCs), Pub/Private Subnets and TGW

This install.sh script provisions 2 VPCs(VPC for ROSA cluster and egress VPC), 3 subnets, a bastion, IGW, NGW and a forward proxy to control cluster's egress traffic. Meanwhile, the script configures OKTA account by creating  an application, authorization server, groups, and all nerccesary component for OIDC configuration in OpenShift

## Setup

Using the code in the repo will require having the following tools installed:

- The Terraform CLI
- The AWS CLI
- The ROSA CLI
- The OC CLI

## Create OKTA account
[Create a OKTA developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)

[Create the API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/main/)

    Sign in to your Okta organization as a user with administrator privileges . ...
    Access the API page: In the Admin Console, select API from the Security menu and then select the Tokens tab.
    Click Create Token.
    Name your token and click Create Token.
    Record the token value.

update terraform variables in [oidc](./oidc/oidc.tf)
## Deploy cluster

update variable in [rosa_sts_prvlnk](./rosa/rosa_sts_prvlnk.tf)

   ```
   install.sh
   ```

 Check that you can access the Console by opening the console url in your browser.
   ‚Äç
   rosa describe cluster -c <clustername>
   

## Cleanup

  Delete cluster and OKTA configuration

    ```
    uninstall.sh
    ```
